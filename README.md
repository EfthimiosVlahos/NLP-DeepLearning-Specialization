### Sentiment Analysis and Word Translation
  
#### What I Learned

In this part of the specialization, I learned how to implement sentiment analysis and translate words using logistic regression, naÃ¯ve Bayes, and word vectors. This foundational work laid the groundwork for understanding how algorithms can interpret and manipulate human language to extract meaning and sentiment from large text datasets.

### Autocorrect and Autocomplete

#### What I Learned

Here, I delved into the creation of autocorrect systems using dynamic programming and hidden Markov models. I also developed skills in completing partial sentences and identifying part-of-speech tags for words, utilizing word embeddings. These projects deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in processing and predicting human language patterns.

### Advanced Text Processing

#### What I Learned

In this module, I explored the use of dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax. I applied these techniques for advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and identifying duplicate questions, which are crucial skills in building sophisticated NLP systems.

### Machine Translation and Chatbots

#### What I Learned

This course segment taught me how to use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention mechanisms for machine translation, text summarization, and question-answering. I also learned how to build chatbots, exploring advanced models like T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and others in the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.

All projects in this repository were part of the NLP Specialization, a foundational program that provides a pathway to the world of AI. The courses helped me gain deep insights into the capabilities, challenges, and intricacies of natural language processing, enabling me to make significant strides in my AI career.

*Note*: These projects were offered by Coursera as part of the NLP Specialization by DeepLearning.AI.
